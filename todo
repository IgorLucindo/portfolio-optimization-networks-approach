iter procedure to test:
    solve using gurobi for 10 min time limit (solution found with k assets, use solution to warmstart)
    solve iterations starting from k going up-bottom, then bottom up (e.g. k->0, k->20), give 1min time limit (or another low value)



Add to paper:
    Compare warmstart with first feasible solution of gurobi
